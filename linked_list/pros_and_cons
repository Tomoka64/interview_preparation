pros and cons of using linked list as an array

[pros]
- Linked List has constant-time insertion and deletion in any position. In comparison, 
array requires O(n) time to do the same thing.
- Linked list can continue to expand without having to specify their size ahead of time

[cons]
- to access an element in a linked list, you need to take O(n) time to go from the head 
of the list to the kth element. In contrast, arrays have constant operation to access an element.
